The objective of this challenge is to build a Text Query Engine in Python.

Your application will receive a series of text documents as a list of strings with a corresponding label.

The engine should:

1. Take the list of documents and build an internal representation of the text.
2. Take a list of labels.
3. Return a list of lists. Each list corresponds to a label and contains the document sorted by their relevance to the label.

Add any external requirements you need to the `requirements.txt` file.

Please submit your completed solution, along with a brief description of your approach and reasoning, within one week of receiving this email to hiring@autoya.de.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need any further clarification.

We're looking forward to seeing your solution!
